## Commands

- `/start` - Greeting.
- `/help`
- `/memo %text%` - Saves text to session.
- `/remind_me` - Replies with text from session.
- `/keyboard` - Simple keyboard.
- `/inline_keyboard` - Inline keyboard example.
- Inline queries. Enable it in BotFather, and your're ready to try 'em.

## Setup

- Clone repo.
- run `./bin/setup`.
- Update `config/secrets.yml` with your bot's token.

## Run

### Development

```
bin/rake telegram:bot:poller
```

### Production

You may want to use different token, because after you setup webhook
you'll need to unset it to run development poller again.

```
bin/rake telegram:bot:set_webhook RAILS_ENV=production
```

And deploy it in any way.

### Testing

```
bin/rspec
```
